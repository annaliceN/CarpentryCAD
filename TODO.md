# TODO List (Jan. 10th)

## References:
* For drill, you need to faces not parallel to each other, distance to these.
* Start an edge -> end an edge, move each points, attach to edges.
* Internal cuts, an initial point reference, automatically change it.
* Cut-through: For the polycut, priority.
* Cool for this tool: List a bunch of tools.
